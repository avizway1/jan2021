Cost Optimization
Performance
Security
Fault Tolerance
Service Limits

Based on Support plan, we will get advises. 
For basic and Developer : 7 core area checks
Business and enterprise : all checks

AWS Shiled : Designed to protect resources from DDoS attack.

AWS shield + Cloudfront + Autoscaling group  = protection from DDoS Attack


Task : Launch existing task with cloudfront.

Task : Launch an ec2 instance, make it as webserver, Launch ELB, add ec2 to elb, test the output... Create a cloudfront to deliver ELB website via cloudfront.













Application Service :
_____________________

--> SQS : Simple Queue Service 

--> SQS is Poll/pull based messeging service.
--> Max msg size SQS supports : 256 kb only
--> AWS cost us based on chunks (1 chunk = 64 kb)

msg = 100 kb = 2 sqs req
msg = 60 kb = 1 sqs req
msg = 250 kb = 4 sqs req

--> Max msg retention period = 14 days
--> We can configure dead-letter queue for undelivered messeges.


SNS : Push based msg service.
