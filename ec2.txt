EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud : 

box = Servers = Instance = Azure VM = Virtual Machine = GCP Engines

Advantages with ec2 : 
--> pay-as-you-go
--> Project : 10 cust.. Future requirements.. 100 cust.. 1000 cust++ : 200cus : 10 cust


On-Demand ec2 instances = Testing application for the first time.. No predictable/stable workloads.. If you are not sure about the config requirement..!!!
Price: /sec (with min of 60 Sec).. 

Reserved ec2 instances = stable / predictable workloads for longer durations.. For long turm run..  Duration : 1 Yr / 3 Yrs.. We need to choose/flinalise config.. 

	Standard RI : We canot change the configuration during the period.
	Convertable RI : We can upgrade the configuration.. 
	Schedured RI : repeated/persistant requests for the longer duration (Ex: Need a server from MON-FRI only, but for 3 Yrs)

Pricing : 
	--> Full Upfront : pay 100% while purchasing.
	--> Partial Upfront : pay 30-50% while purchasing.. remaing pay monthly basis with reduced pricing.
	--> No upfront : Pay everything monthly basis.


Spot ec2 instances = If we are flexible to stop/start instances.. We need to bid our pricing against AWS pricing.. We can test application with high configs at low price..

--> If price increased, AWS terminated our instance, we no need to pay partial hours..
1:45 Min : AWS Terminated : 1 Hr only
1:45 Min : You terminated : 1:45 min


Tenancy:
Shared tenancy : Underlying hardware will be shared with multiple customers.
Dedicated tenancy : Underlying resources will be delivered to only one customer.
	--> Dedicated Instance : 
	--> Dedicated host :

EC2 is Region specific service.
--> Mumbai (Primary)
--> N Virginia (Secondary)


FREE Tier : 
750 Hrs/Month.. t2.micro.. Windows 
750 Hrs/Month.. t2.micro.. Linux

Storage : 30gb/Month


Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)	: Operating System

Step 2: Choose an Instance Type			: COnfiuration of server (CPU, Memory)

General Purpose : stable perf of compute, Memory and Network resources.. : t2, t3, m5, m4
Compute Optimized : High CPU utiliation..: c5, c6, c4
Memory Optimized : More RAM memory perf.. : r4, r5, x1, z1
GPU Optimised : More graphic perf.. P2, P3, G3, G4, F1
Storage Optimized : More storage pef.. : d2, d3, i3en


Shutdown behavior: Stop/Terminate : stop

Step 3 : CHoose Storage

Step 4 : Add required Tags (Applocation, Platform, Cost Center)

Step 5 : Configure the Security Groups
Ports : (0-65535)

RDP : Windows : 3389 :   
SSH : Linux : 22 : 
Webserver : http : 80

Step 6 : Review and launch. Create a Keypair..

Public key (AWS Instance) and Private Key (We downloaded)

Public IP : unique across the globe. Use public ip to get connect to the ec2 instance.

Open run (windows + r) --> mstsc --> Enter.


Stop and Start :
Terminate : Deletes the instance.


Task : Launch a Windows instance, Change the administrator password.. Logout from instance.. try to login to instance with Keypair given password..?? Allow/deny.??

Task 2 : Make your instance as IIS Webserver and deliver the webpage to everyone.

Task 3 : Create another user within our ec2 instance, provide the lcoal admin rights to that user and Take a Remote session with newly created user.
