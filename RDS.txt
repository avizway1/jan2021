RDS : Relational Database Service
--> Data stores in tabular format.

--> Amazon Aurora  : Mysql compatable & PostGreSQL compatable : Mysql workbench / Pgadmin
--> Mysql	   : Mysql Workbench
--> Microsoft SQL  : SSMS (Sql server management studio)
--> PostGreSQL	   : PgAdmin
--> MariaDB	   : Workbench
--> Oracle	   : Orcle native, TOAD

--> NoSQL DB : Data stores in JSON format. : Serverless
	--> DynamoDB

--> Caching : 
	--> Elasticache : supports 2 caching engines
		--> Memcached
		--> Redis

--> Datawarehousing solution 
	--> Amazon Redshift

--> Database Migration : DMS : Database Migration service


--> We cannot get connect and see what is happening at OS level.
--> We always run our WEB Servers and Database Servers in PRIVATE SUBNET.
--> Public Access : NO
--> We use Jump server to connect to DB instances. 
--> Whenever we perform any major modification, RDS creates a backup copy automatically.

Backup retention : It keeps last 7 days backup copies. 

--> For RDS instance, we will get an Endpoint, not an IP Address. 


Task : Launch Mysql Databse in CustomVPC's Private SUbnet. Launch Jump server in customVPC public SUbnet, install Mysql Workbench then connect to the RDS DB.
*Make sure you follow Security group standards as we discussed.

MultiAZ Deployment :
--> create a standby instance in Another AZ.
--> We will get same enedpoint for both the instances.
--> Multi-AZ is for DR (Disaster Recovery) purpose only.
--> Not for scaling purpose.


ReadReplica : 
--> RR Designed for scaling purpose.
--> We can offload the read operations from master copy to replica copies.
--> We can create 5 Mysql replicas, 15 aurora replicas.

Snapshots : Backup copy of our RDS instance. 
--> Point-in-time-recovery
--> It's not an Inplace restoration.

System Backups/Automated backups : Backup copies created by AWS. We cannot delete these backups.
--> Based on "Backup Retention" value we will get these Automated backups.
--> When we delete instance, these backups delete.
--> Min backup retention period : 1 Day / Defualt 7 days / Max 35 Days

Manual Backups : We need to crete manual backups. 
--> WOn;t delete along with rds instance.
--> We can share this snapshot to another region / We can share to another aws account also.

--> Percona Xtra Backup is an 3rd party backup software, we can integrate with s3.

Elasticache : It's a caching service for our RDS instances.
--> Duplicated requests execuiting on RDS instance, will be delovered by this service.
--> It supprts 2 open source caching engines.
	--> MemcacheD
	--> Redis (it's own authentication RedisAUTH,, MultiAZ failover)



DMS : Database Migration Service : 

Homogenious migration : If source and destination contains same db engine. (mysql --> mysql)  Source --> DMS --> Destination
Heterogenious migration : If source and destination contains differnt db engine. (db3 --> mysql)	Source --> DMS --> SCT (Schema Convertion tool) --> Destination

Task : Launch RDS instance 1 in Default VPC, and restore the shared database to the RDS instance 1.

Launch another RDS instance 2 in CUstom VPC and keep it with no data.

Launch DMS instance, Create Source, destinations and Create a replication job.
--> Once job is completed, you should able to see all the data in RDS inatnce 2.
