Block Based Storage : Used/designed to run the OS. : Servers : EBS/InstanceStore : EC2

Object Based Storage : Designed to store the objects.. We cannot install anything.. We cannot run any Applications / OS.. : Store any file format.. : Gdrive/Dropbox/onedrive
: S3

Network Based Storage : Storage over the network.. SAN/NAS : EFS & FSx

S3 : Simple Storage Service : 
--> We have Buckets. We can store all the data in buckets.
--> Bucket name should be unique across the globe.

S3 Bucket Naming limitations:
--> Min Char 3, Max 63 Char..
--> Should not contains Capital Letters
--> Should not start with .
--> Should not end with .
--> No Adjesent ..
--> Should not resemble IP Address Format

Free Tier : S3
--> 5 Gb Standard Storage.. 
--> 2000 PUT Operation / 20,000 GET Operations

--> S3 : No Pre-Provisioning required.
--> We will get charged based on the data we actually stored.
--> Based on ACcess Patterns we need to choose the right storage class.

S3 Standard : Frequently Accessed Data : AZs >= 3 data spreads in backend.. 
Availability : 99.99%  Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9s).. 
Data availbale immediatly.. 

S3 Standard-IA : Less Freq accessed data..   AZs  >=3 AZs.. 
Availability : 99.9%  Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9s).. 
Data availbale immediatly.. 

OneZone-IA : Less Freq accessed data..   AZs -->  1 AZs.. 
Availability : 99.5%  Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9s).. 
Data availbale immediatly.. 

Glacier : Archive the data.. AZs  >=3 AZs.. 
Data will not be availbale immediatly.. Initialise data restoration to view the data.. 
Restoration : Min- Hrs...  
(Standard Restore/retrival : 3-5 Hrs
Expedited Restore/retrival : 1-5 Min (Less than 250 mb)
Bulk restore : Hrs 5-12 Hrs)

Glacier Deep Archieve: Archive the data.. AZs  >=3 AZs.. 
Data will not be availbale immediatly.. Initialise data restoration to view the data.. 
Restoration : Hrs... 

Intelligent tier : If we have unknown access patterns for our data.. Long-lived data with changing or unknown access patterns... AZs  >=3 AZs.. 
	--> IT-Archive
	--> IT-Deep Archive

Reduced redundancy Storage : RRS : Not Recommanded..!!
Durability : 99.99%..

Https://bucketname.s3.regionname.amazonaws.com/objectname

https://s3.regionname.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname	--> If we have . in bucket name


Turn off the "Block public access" settings at bucket level. Then make object public. With URL we can access the objects.


Versioning : If we enable versioning on s3 bucket.
--> We will have multiple versioned objects.
--> If we delete accidentally, We can restore the object.

Most recent uploaded object = Latest Version / Current version.

If we delete a Current/latest version, we will get a delete market (vision:hide)

If you need to undo the delete action, you can delete the delete markers. We will get the object back to s3 bucket.

____

SRR/CRR : DR (Disaster Recovery) Solution
Same region replication : keep another copy of our data in same region bucket.
Cross region replication : keep another copy of our data in another region bucket.

--> Existing data will not be replicated to destination bucket.
--> All the ongoing/future uplaods will replicate to destination bucket.

Task : Create multiple buckets in mumbai region.. Configure Same Region replication between these buckets.

Task : Explore bucket versioning.

Life Cycle Management rules : 


CLI : 100gb --> Upload --> Multipart upload..   chunks (small parts)

S3 Static website hosting : 
--> S3 supports only static website hosting. 
--> Bucket name = Domain Name
--> Your bucket data should be publicly accessable.

http status codes :

2xx : OK/Success
3XX : Redirection error
4XX : Client side error
5XX : Server Side error

Intelligent-Tiering Archive configurations: 
--> Enable objects stored in the Intelligent-Tiering storage class to tier-down to the Archive Access tier or the Deep Archive Access tier which are optimized for objects that will be rarely accessed for long periods of time.


Whatever the file accessed in last 90 days, it will be in IT only.. But iof the file not accessed in last 90 days it will be moved to IT-Archive..

In-transit Encryption : SSL/TLS 
--> S3 enabled with InTransit encryption.

Server Side Encryption (SSE)/At-Rest Encryption

SSE - S3 : An encryption key that Amazon S3 creates, manages, and uses for you. Whoever have valid permissions in s3 platform, they can view the data. (FREE TIER) 

SSE - KMS : 
amazon managed keys:   aws/s3 :  In KMS FOr s3, we will get a key.. An encryption key that Amazon Key Management Service creates, manages, and uses for you. Whoever have valid permissions in s3 platform, they can view the data. (FREE TIER) 

Customer Managed Keys:	aws/customkey by KMS : We can generate a Key by KMS, KMS Manages the Key creation, managing... Key Material is KMS responsibiity.

SSE - C : We need to provide the key material to aws KMS service.. KMS manages the encryption and decryption.. 


Client Side Encryption (CSE): 
--> Before uploading the data, we can encrypt and we can send/store encrypted data in s3 platform.

____

Key Users : Who can use the key to decrypt the data.
Key Administrators : Who can administrate the key.. Delete/provide permissions..

Symmetric : A single encryption key that is used for both encrypt and decrypt operations
Asymmetric : A public and private key pair that can be used for encrypt/decrypt or sign/verify operations


________

Server access logging : Enable logging for a particular bucket. 

Object Lock : Additional layer of security for our s3 data. Protect data from delete operations.

Governance : Users with specific IAM permissions can overwrite or delete protected object versions during the retention period.

Compliance
No users can overwrite or delete protected object versions during the retention period.
