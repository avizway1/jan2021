Block Based Storage : Used/designed to run the OS. : Servers : EBS/InstanceStore : EC2

Object Based Storage : Designed to store the objects.. We cannot install anything.. We cannot run any Applications / OS.. : Store any file format.. : Gdrive/Dropbox/onedrive
: S3

Network Based Storage : Storage over the network.. SAN/NAS : EFS & FSx

S3 : Simple Storage Service : 
--> We have Buckets. We can store all the data in buckets.
--> Bucket name should be unique across the globe.

S3 Bucket Naming limitations:
--> Min Char 3, Max 63 Char..
--> Should not contains Capital Letters
--> Should not start with .
--> Should not end with .
--> No Adjesent ..
--> Should not resemble IP Address Format

Free Tier : S3
--> 5 Gb Standard Storage.. 
--> 2000 PUT Operation / 20,000 GET Operations

--> S3 : No Pre-Provisioning required.
--> We will get charged based on the data we actually stored.
--> Based on ACcess Patterns we need to choose the right storage class.

S3 Standard : Frequently Accessed Data : AZs >= 3 data spreads in backend.. 
Availability : 99.99%  Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9s).. 
Data availbale immediatly.. 

S3 Standard-IA : Less Freq accessed data..   AZs  >=3 AZs.. 
Availability : 99.9%  Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9s).. 
Data availbale immediatly.. 

OneZone-IA : Less Freq accessed data..   AZs -->  1 AZs.. 
Availability : 99.5%  Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9s).. 
Data availbale immediatly.. 

Glacier : Archive the data.. AZs  >=3 AZs.. 
Data will not be availbale immediatly.. Initialise data restoration to view the data.. 
Restoration : Min- Hrs...  
(Standard Restore/retrival : 3-5 Hrs
Expedited Restore/retrival : 1-5 Min (Less than 250 mb)
Bulk restore : Hrs 5-12 Hrs)

Glacier Deep Archieve: Archive the data.. AZs  >=3 AZs.. 
Data will not be availbale immediatly.. Initialise data restoration to view the data.. 
Restoration : Hrs... 

Intelligent tier : If we have unknown access patterns for our data.. Long-lived data with changing or unknown access patterns... AZs  >=3 AZs.. 

Reduced redundancy Storage : RRS : Not Recommanded..!!
Durability : 99.99%..

Https://bucketname.s3.regionname.amazonaws.com/objectname

https://s3.regionname.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname	--> If we have . in bucket name


Turn off the "Block public access" settings at bucket level. Then make object public. With URL we can access the objects.


Versioning : If we enable versioning on s3 bucket.
--> We will have multiple versioned objects.
--> If we delete accidentally, We can restore the object.

Most recent uploaded object = Latest Version / Current version.

If we delete a Current/latest version, we will get a delete market (vision:hide)

If you need to undo the delete action, you can delete the delete markers. We will get the object back to s3 bucket.

____

SRR/CRR : DR (Disaster Recovery) Solution
Same region replication : keep another copy of our data in same region bucket.
Cross region replication : keep another copy of our data in another region bucket.

--> Existing data will not be replicated to destination bucket.
--> All the ongoing/future uplaods will replicate to destination bucket.

Task : Create multiple buckets in mumbai region.. Configure Same Region replication between these buckets.

Task : Explore bucket versioning.
